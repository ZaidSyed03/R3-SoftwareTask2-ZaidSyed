My code is a simple one-stop-shop! Run the code and use the keyboard for input no need for fancy class files or servers. Why do it that way when you can make it easier and more quickly?

If I am being honest I just didn't have the time to really make a good class file, server, etc. with midterms coming up and the shock of the previous marks I needed time to 
gather myself. 
But you may be asking why would I be a good candidate if I didn't even finish the task as intended. 
The answer is simple, experience and passion. I've always had a passion for robots I started the robot team in my middle school and got us into competitions that the school still
goes on. I pushed to get a robotics team in my high school. 
Even now with the pandemic, I bought myself a kit to experiment with using my raspberry Pi. 
I love computers, robots and problem-solving. With coding, those things go hand and hand. 
If I don't know how to do something I will find a way to either work around or learn it because of my passion for this. 
I can almost guarantee no one else being evaluated can say the same.
